'''EXPLANATION:- 
Let’s break down this SQL query from first principles — meaning we'll understand each concept and logic behind it from scratch, step by step.

🧠 First Principles Explanation of the Query
We’ll start from the basic building blocks:

🔹 1. Databases & Tables
Imagine you have two tables:

db_employee (alias e) — contains data about employees, including their salaries and which department they belong to (via a department_id).

db_dept (alias d) — contains department details like id and department name (e.g., "Marketing", "Engineering").

🔹 2. JOIN Operation
sql -
from db_employee e
join db_dept d on e.department_id = d.id
  
This means we are combining employee data with their corresponding department names by matching:

e.department_id (from employee table)

d.id (from department table)

👉 Why? Because we want to use the department names (like "marketing" or "engineering") alongside the employee’s salary.

🔹 3. WHERE Clause: Filtering Specific Departments
sql
Copy
Edit
where lower(d.department) in ("marketing", "engineering")
Here we are filtering the data to only include rows where the department is either “marketing” or “engineering”. We're using lower() to ensure case-insensitive comparison, so that “Marketing” or “MARKETING” will still match.

🔹 4. CASE WHEN Logic in Aggregation
Now we get to the most important and clever part:

sql
Copy
Edit
select max(
    case when d.department = "marketing" then e.salary
    end
) 
This line means:

Go through each row.

If the department is “marketing”, keep the salary, otherwise return NULL.

Then apply MAX() — which will ignore NULLs and return the maximum salary in Marketing.

Similarly:

sql
Copy
Edit
- max(case when d.department = "engineering" then e.salary end)
returns the maximum salary in Engineering.

🔹 5. Subtracting the Two MAX Salaries
sql
Copy
Edit
as sal_diff
So, we’re calculating the difference between the maximum Marketing salary and the maximum Engineering salary.

📌 Final Result:
The output is a single value:

ini
Copy
Edit
sal_diff = MAX(Marketing Salary) - MAX(Engineering Salary)
✅ What This Query Tells You:
“What is the difference between the highest salary in the Marketing department and the highest salary in the Engineering department?”

If the result is:

Positive: Highest Marketing salary is more than Engineering.

Negative: Highest Engineering salary is more than Marketing.

Zero: They’re equal.
